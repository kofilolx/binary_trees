# Binary Trees Project

This project is a simple implementation of binary trees, aimed at providing a basic understanding of tree data structures and their operations. 

## Authors
- Kotey Jonathan Nikoi

## Overview
Binary trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, each having a maximum of two children nodes referred to as the left child and the right child. This project explores the fundamental operations on binary trees such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

## Features
- Insertion of nodes into the binary tree.
- Deletion of nodes from the binary tree.
- Traversal algorithms including in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
- Searching for a specific element within the binary tree.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile and run the provided source code.
4. Follow the instructions to interact with the binary tree functionalities.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests.
